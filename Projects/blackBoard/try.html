<!-- Here is a list of the simpler line smoothing algorithms you can use:

1. Moving Average
Description: A basic technique that averages each point with its neighbors to smooth the data.
Use Case: General-purpose smoothing and noise reduction.
Example: Simple moving average (SMA), weighted moving average (WMA).
2. Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
Description: Similar to moving average, but gives more weight to recent data points, making it more responsive.
Use Case: When you want the curve to respond faster to recent changes.
Example: Exponential smoothing with an adjustable smoothing factor (alpha).
3. Gaussian Filter
Description: Applies a Gaussian distribution (bell curve) to smooth the points, giving more weight to points near the center of the window.
Use Case: When you want smoothing with a softer transition between points.
Example: Apply a Gaussian kernel to data points and use it to calculate the smoothed values.
4. Catmull-Rom Splines (Interpolation)
Description: A type of interpolation that produces smooth curves passing through the given points. It's commonly used in graphics to create smooth, flexible curves.
Use Case: When you need smooth curves that pass through a set of control points.
Example: Catmull-Rom spline interpolation with a parameter t to control smoothness.
5. Linear Interpolation (Lerp)
Description: Uses linear interpolation between points to create a smooth path. While this isn't technically "smoothing," it can generate a smooth line between points by connecting them with straight lines.
Use Case: Quick smoothing with straight lines between points.
Example: Linearly interpolate between consecutive points.
6. B-Splines
Description: A piecewise polynomial curve that allows for smoother control over the curve with more flexible degree and continuity.
Use Case: When you need flexible, smooth curves with control over the degree of smoothness and flexibility.
Example: B-splines are often used in computer graphics for more control over curve design. -->
